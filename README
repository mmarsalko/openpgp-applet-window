**** OpenPGP_Applet - GNOME applet for OpenPGP text encryption ****


OpenPGP_Applet is a gnome applet written in perl that allows encrypting and decrypting the
content of the clipboard with a symmetric cipher using a passphrase. This is a
graphical frontend on top of GnuPG.

Asymmetric decryption and clipboard verification are also supported.

Formally a part of Tails - tails.boum.org, now available separatly.


IMPORTANT: 

OpenPGP_Applet does not handle passphrase input. Since it also does not offer
terminal interaction unless explicitly run from there, it relies in practice on
some kind of GnuPG agent such as pinentry, Seahorse 2.x or GNOME keyring 3.x to
manage passphrase input.

Full user documentation, with screenshots, is available at
