**** OpenPGP_Applet - GNOME applet for OpenPGP text encryption ****


OpenPGP_Applet is a GNOME applet written in Perl that allows encryption and
decryption of the clipboard's content with a symmetric cipher using a
passphrase. This is a graphical front-end on top of GnuPG.

Asymmetric decryption and clipboard verification are also supported.

Formally a part of Tails - tails.boum.org, now available separately.


IMPORTANT: 

OpenPGP_Applet does not handle passphrase input. Since it also does not offer
terminal interaction unless explicitly run from there, it relies in practice on
some kind of GnuPG agent such as Pinentry, Seahorse 2.x or GNOME Keyring 3.x to
manage passphrase input.

'xclip' (http://xclip.sourceforge.net) is used to get input from clipboard.
