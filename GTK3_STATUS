What doesn't work :
- encrypt / sign
- decrypt / verify

    Apparently, similar issue with function call on both (missing args):
    Gtk3::Clipboard::set_text: passed too few parameters (expected 3, got 2) at ./bin/openpgp-applet line 331.

- errors while browsing available keys :
*** unhandled exception in callback:
***   Can't locate object method "get_indices" via package "6" (perhaps you forgot to load "6"?) at ./bin/openpgp-applet line 443.
***  ignoring at /usr/share/perl5/Gtk3.pm line 767.
Related to the usage of Gtk3::SimpleList, apparently. Doesn't seem to work exactly the same as the Gtk2 counterpart.

what works :
- app launches without error
- menus (both)
- getting content of primary and secondary clipboards and change the icon accordingly
